# Hey, I'm Timur

I'm a DevOps and cloud enthusiast currently employed by DB Systel GmbH in Frankfurt.

Whatever the role, I'm focused on productivity, simplicity and getting software ready for production.

During my wild ride in the industry I keep on learning new stuff that I try to write down in this blog so that you don't have to learn it the hard way.
